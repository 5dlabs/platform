## Security Features

This repository has the following security measures in place:

- ✅ **Push Protection**: Enabled - prevents accidental commits of secrets
- ✅ **Secret Scanning**: Enabled - scans for known secret patterns
- ✅ **Validity Checks**: Enabled - verifies if detected secrets are active
- ✅ **Custom Patterns**: Configured for organization-specific secrets
- 🔒 **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local secret scanning before commits

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables or secret management systems
2. **Use `.gitignore`** - Ensure sensitive files are excluded
3. **Regular rotation** - Rotate credentials regularly
4. **Least privilege** - Grant minimal necessary permissions
5. **Review warnings** - Take push protection warnings seriously

## If a Secret is Exposed

If you accidentally expose a secret:

1. **Immediately revoke** the exposed credential
2. **Generate new credentials**
3. **Update all systems** using the credential
4. **Review logs** for any unauthorized access
5. **Report the incident** to security@5dlabs.com

# 5D Labs Platform Roadmap

The 5D Labs Platform is evolving to become the premier AI-driven development platform. This roadmap outlines our planned features and enhancements to deliver more powerful, intelligent, and cost-effective development workflows.

## 🚀 Immediate Priorities

### Documentation Auto-Ingestion
**Automatic architecture and PRD documentation integration**
- Auto-detect and ingest architecture documents from repositories
- Parse PRD (Product Requirements Document) files into agent context
- Dynamic documentation discovery and indexing

### MCP Tools Integration
**Curated tool selection and management**
- Template-driven tool documentation generation
- Selective tool enablement per agent configuration
- Tool usage guidelines
- Dynamic tool capability detection and documentation

## 🔧 Core Platform Enhancements

### QA Agent System
**Autonomous quality assurance and testing**
- Pull request monitoring and automated testing
- Functionality validation before code quality checks
- Integration with Tasks system for acceptance criteria
- Self-healing deployment capabilities
- Automated PR approval workflow (human-gated merging)

### Sequential Task Dependencies
**Dependency-aware task execution and orchestration**
- Task dependency management with configurable prerequisites
- Automatic task triggering when dependencies are merged to main
- Integration with GitHub monitoring service for PR merge events
- Dependency graph visualization and management
- Failure propagation and recovery strategies for dependent tasks
- Support for complex dependency chains across multiple services

### Multi-CLI Integration
**Support for diverse AI development tools**
- **Grok CLI** - X.AI's development assistant integration
- **Gemini CLI** - Google's Gemini model integration
- **All Hands CLI** - OpenHands development agent support
- Unified interface across different AI providers
- Consistent workflow regardless of underlying CLI

### GitHub Projects Synchronization
**Visual project management integration**
- Integration with [5D Labs Tasks](https://github.com/5dlabs/tasks) system
- Automatic task synchronization with GitHub Projects
- Visual progress tracking and team collaboration
- Agent assignment based on service ownership
- Real-time status updates and milestone tracking

### Configuration Management
**Environment-specific deployment configuration**
- Environment variable overrides for all service URLs
- Configurable telemetry endpoints (OTLP, logging)
- Flexible MCP server URL configuration
- Support for different deployment environments (local, cloud, on-premises)
- Configuration validation and documentation

## 🎭 Agent Specialization

### Agent Profiles
**Specialized agents for different domains**
